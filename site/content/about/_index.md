What's up? 

Yeah!. Lets drive into the topic, I started my software development life as embedded system developer, had a lots of fun paring software and hardware. Then I switch to the web development (yeah became a spider :/ )  and thing got more excited and I'm still exploring that new world. It's been more than 8 years.
